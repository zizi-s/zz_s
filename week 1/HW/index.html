<h3>Instructions</h3>
<!-- ol = ordered list. these list item, order matters -->

    <li>Prep Potatoes: Peel Russet potatoes and cut them into thin \(1/4\)-inch by \(1/4\)-inch sticks (approx. 4-6 inches long).</li>
    <li>Soak & Rinse: Soak potato strips in cold water, rinsing 2-3 times until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.</li>
    <li>Blanch/Cook: Boil the potato strips in water with 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp white vinegar for 10 minutes to ensure a tender interior.</li>
    <li>Dry & Freeze: Drain the potatoes, pat them completely dry, and freeze for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    <li>First Fry (Par-fry): Heat oil (vegetable oil or a mix with beef tallow) to 350°F-360°F. Fry in batches for 50 seconds to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cool & Re-freeze: Drain and let the fries cool completely. For best results, freeze the par-fried potatoes for at least 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Second Fry (Finish): Heat oil to 400°F. Fry the frozen, par-fried potatoes for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and crispy.</li>
    <li>Season: Remove, drain, and immediately toss with fine salt.</li>
