# McDonald's French Fries

#### *thin, batonnet-cut strips of potato that are deep-fried until golden and crispy on the outside and soft inside*

## Ingredients:
-Potatoes

-Vegetable oil (canola, corn, soybean, hydrogenated soybean)

-Natural beef flavor (wheat and milk derivatives)

-Dextrose

-Sodium acid pyrophosphate

-Salt

## Instructions:
1. Prep Potatoes: Peel Russet potatoes and cut them into thin \(1/4\)-inch by \(1/4\)-inch sticks (approx. 4-6 inches long).
2. Soak & Rinse: Soak potato strips in cold water, rinsing 2-3 times until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
3. Blanch/Cook: Boil the potato strips in water with 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp white vinegar for 10 minutes to ensure a tender interior.
4. Dry & Freeze: Drain the potatoes, pat them completely dry, and freeze for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.
5. First Fry (Par-fry): Heat oil (vegetable oil or a mix with beef tallow) to 350°F-360°F. Fry in batches for 50 seconds to 2 minutes.
6. Cool & Re-freeze: Drain and let the fries cool completely. For best results, freeze the par-fried potatoes for at least 1 hour.
7. Second Fry (Finish): Heat oil to 400°F. Fry the frozen, par-fried potatoes for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and crispy.
8. Season: Remove, drain, and immediately toss with fine salt.
